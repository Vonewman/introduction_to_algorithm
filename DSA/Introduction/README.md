* What is an algorithm ?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

### Qualities of a good program 
* 1. Input and output should be defined precisely.

* 2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.

* 3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.

* 4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
